Forked from [pintree](https://github.com/Pintree-io/pintree), add a python script to generate a json file from a firefox bookmark html file.

## Steps

1. export html file from firefox
2. set the input and output file path in `html2json.py` properly
3. run `python html2json.py`
4. rename the output file as `pintree.json` and move to `json/`
